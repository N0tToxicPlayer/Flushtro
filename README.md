(THIS MOD MIGHT PROBABLY CRASH BUT IM TOO LAZY TO TROUBLESHOOT THEM :3)
# Flushtro
Requires: [Steammodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods) and [Talisman](https://github.com/SpectralPack/Talisman)

Unbalanced mess of a mod
includes:
* jokers
* and consumables

## Short QNA
> *Is this in [Balatro Mod Manager](https://github.com/skyline69/balatro-mod-manager)?*

 yes.

> *I don't see any new jokers.*

If you installed the mod correctly, check the mods list and look for Flushtro (it's usually the last on the list),
if it shows as red, hover over the mod icon and see what the problem was (it's probably outdated depedencies).

> *Is there an official discord server?*

Not yet. but im sometimes active in the [Joker Forge Discord Server](https://discord.gg/eRBByq9AZX), you can
report a bug or suggest a joker in the [mod's forum](https://discord.com/channels/1398404149691023491/1402336225947418756/1402336225947418756)

> *Whats with the 'Alerto' Jokers?*

A good friend of mine in an server im in.
